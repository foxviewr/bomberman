A simple Bomberman-inspired browser game built with **Node.js**, **VueJS**, and **Nuxt.js**.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Terraform** (>= 1.0.0)

### Install Docker
- [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.
- After installation, verify Docker is running:
  ```sh
  docker --version
  docker info
  ```

### Install Terraform
- [Download Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.
- After installation, verify Terraform is installed:
  ```sh
  terraform version
  ```

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:foxviewr/bomberman.git
cd bomberman
```

### 2. Build and Run with Docker & Terraform

#### a. Build the Docker Images and Start Containers

1. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```sh
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```
2. **Apply the Terraform configuration:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```
   - Approve the plan when prompted.

#### b. Access the Game
- **Production (SSR) mode:** [http://localhost:8087](http://localhost:8087)
- **Development (hot reload) mode:** [http://localhost:8093](http://localhost:8093)

---

## Custom Docker & Terraform Configurations

- **Production (SSR) Container:**
  - Uses `Dockerfile` to build and run the Nuxt SSR server on port 3000 (mapped to 8087 on your host).
- **Development Container:**
  - Uses `Dockerfile.dev` to run `npm run dev` on port 3000 (mapped to 8093 on your host).
- **Terraform** manages both containers and images. See `terraform/main.tf` for details.

---

## Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop and remove all containers:
```sh
cd .. # if you're in the terraform directory
./cleanup_docker.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see the default Nginx page or changes are not reflected, try:
  - Running `./cleanup_docker.sh` to remove old containers.
  - Rebuilding the Docker images with `docker build --no-cache ...`.
  - Forcing Terraform to recreate containers:
    ```sh
    terraform apply -replace="docker_container.bomberman"
    terraform apply -replace="docker_container.bomberman_dev"
    ```
- For browser cache issues, use a hard refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`) or open in incognito mode.

## How to Play

- **Move:** Use the arrow keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí) to move your character.
- **Drop Bomb:** Press the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to drop a bomb (you can only drop as many bombs as your current power allows).
- **Destroy Walls:** Bombs will destroy breakable (orange) walls in a cross pattern. Unbreakable (gray) walls block explosions.
- **Collect Power-ups:**
  - üí• (blue/white): Increases your bomb explosion area by 1.
  - üí£ (red/white): Allows you to place one more bomb at the same time.
- **Win:** Destroy all breakable walls to win. Your completion time will be displayed.
- **Lose:** If you are caught in a bomb explosion, you lose the game.
- **Restart:** Use the on-screen button to play again after winning or losing.

Enjoy playing!
